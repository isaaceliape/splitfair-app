# EPIC: Modernize Build Stack and Architecture

## Epic Overview

**As a** development team maintaining the Splitfair PWA,  
**we want** to modernize our entire technology stack,  
**so that** we can achieve faster development cycles, smaller bundle sizes, and improved maintainability while keeping the application fully functional.

## Epic Goal

Transform the Splitfair PWA from a traditional Vue.js application with Vue CLI and npm into a modern, lightweight web application using native Web Components, Vite, and Bun - delivering the same user experience with significantly improved developer experience and performance.

## Business Value

- **50-70% faster build times** with Vite
- **80% faster package installation** with Bun
- **Reduced bundle size** by removing Vue.js overhead
- **Improved developer productivity** through faster iteration cycles
- **Future-proof architecture** with web standards
- **Easier maintenance** with less complex dependencies

## User Stories Included

### 1. Remove Vue.js Framework

**Reference**: [remove-vue-js-user-story.md](./remove-vue-js-user-story.md)

**Summary**: Convert all Vue components to native Web Components, remove Vue.js dependency, and implement custom state management.

**Key Deliverables**:

- 6 Vue components converted to Web Components
- Global store replacing Vuex
- Shadow DOM for style encapsulation
- Custom Events for component communication

### 2. Migrate Package Manager to Bun

**Reference**: [migrate-to-bun-user-story.md](./migrate-to-bun-user-story.md)

**Summary**: Replace npm with Bun for faster dependency management and improved development workflow.

**Key Deliverables**:

- Bun.lockb file generation
- Updated development scripts
- CI/CD pipeline updates
- Team training on Bun usage

### 3. Adopt Vite as Build Tool ✅

**Reference**: [adopt-vite-user-story.md](./adopt-vite-user-story.md)

**Summary**: Replace Vue CLI with Vite for lightning-fast development server and optimized production builds.

**Key Deliverables**:

- vite.config.js configuration ✅
- PWA plugin migration ✅
- Updated build scripts ✅
- Performance optimizations ✅

## Technical Architecture Vision

### Before (Current Stack)

```
Vue.js 2/3 + Vuex + Vue CLI + npm
├── Vue Single File Components
├── Vue Router (if applicable)
├── Vue CLI build pipeline
├── npm package management
└── Traditional bundling
```

### After (Modern Stack)

```
Web Components + Vite + Bun
├── Native Custom Elements
├── Shadow DOM encapsulation
├── Vite build pipeline
├── Bun package management
└── ESM + modern bundling
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Web Components Migration)

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Focus**: Remove Vue.js dependency

- Convert all Vue components to Web Components
- Implement global state management
- Test all functionality thoroughly

### Phase 2: Build Tool Modernization

**Duration**: 1 week
**Focus**: Replace Vue CLI with Vite

- Migrate build configuration
- Setup PWA plugins
- Optimize for performance

### Phase 3: Package Management Upgrade

**Duration**: 3-5 days
**Focus**: Adopt Bun

- Update development workflows
- Modify CI/CD pipelines
- Train development team

### Phase 4: Optimization and Polish

**Duration**: 1 week
**Focus**: Performance and quality

- Bundle analysis and optimization
- Cross-browser testing
- Documentation completion

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Sequential Dependencies

1. **Web Components Migration** must complete before Vite migration
2. **Vite Migration** can happen in parallel with Bun adoption
3. **Bun Migration** is independent but benefits from Vite

### Team Prerequisites

- Developers familiar with modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Understanding of Web Components APIs
- Experience with build tools (Vite knowledge helpful but not required)
- Willingness to learn Bun package manager

### Infrastructure Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ (for Vite compatibility)
- Modern browsers for Web Components support
- CI/CD environment supporting Bun

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

- **Web Components browser support**: May require polyfills for older browsers
- **State management complexity**: Manual reactivity vs Vue's automatic system
- **Build tool migration**: Potential configuration incompatibilities

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Progressive enhancement**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **Comprehensive testing**: Extensive QA before each phase completion
- **Rollback plans**: Ability to revert changes if critical issues arise
- **Incremental migration**: Each phase can be validated independently

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics

- **Development Experience**: 80%+ improvement in startup and HMR times
- **Build Performance**: 50%+ reduction in build times
- **Bundle Efficiency**: 30-50% reduction in bundle size
- **Installation Speed**: 80%+ faster dependency installation

### Quality Metrics

- **Code Quality**: 100% ESLint compliance
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain existing test coverage levels
- **Browser Support**: 95%+ modern browser compatibility
- **Performance Score**: Lighthouse score maintained or improved

### Business Metrics

- **Developer Productivity**: Faster feature development cycles
