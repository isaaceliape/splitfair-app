# User Story: Migrate from npm to Bun

## User Story

**As a** developer working on the Splitfair PWA project,  
**I want** to migrate the package manager from npm to Bun,  
**so that** I can benefit from Bun's faster installation speeds, improved performance, and better development experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [x] All project dependencies are successfully installed using Bun
- [x] All npm scripts (build, lint, serve, etc.) work correctly with Bun
- [x] The `bun.lockb` file is properly generated and maintained
- [x] No breaking changes to the existing build process
- [x] All team members can use Bun without additional setup

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] Installation time is significantly reduced compared to npm
- [x] Development server startup time is improved
- [x] Build times remain consistent or improve
- [x] No impact on production bundle size or performance

## Technical Details

### Current State

- Project currently uses npm as package manager
- Dependencies managed via `package.json`
- Scripts defined in `package.json` scripts section

### Target State

- Use Bun as the primary package manager
- Leverage Bun's native TypeScript support
- Utilize Bun's faster runtime for development tasks
- Maintain compatibility with existing tooling

### Migration Steps

1. **Install Bun**: Ensure Bun is installed on all development machines
2. **Update Documentation**: Update README and development setup instructions
3. **Test Migration**: Run `bun install` and verify all dependencies resolve
4. **Update Scripts**: Ensure all npm scripts work with `bun run`
5. **Update CI/CD**: Modify any CI/CD pipelines to use Bun instead of npm
6. **Team Training**: Provide guidance for team members on Bun usage

### Dependencies to Verify

- Vue CLI build tools
- ESLint and Prettier
- Konva.js for canvas functionality
- Any native dependencies that may require special handling

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Some packages may not be compatible with Bun
  - **Mitigation**: Test thoroughly and identify alternatives if needed
- **Risk**: Team members unfamiliar with Bun
  - **Mitigation**: Provide training and documentation
- **Risk**: CI/CD pipeline incompatibilities
  - **Mitigation**: Update pipeline configurations and test thoroughly

## Implementation Summary

The Bun migration has been successfully completed with the following changes:

### Scripts Updated

- `dev`: `bun run --hot src/main.js` for development with hot reload
- `serve`: Alias for `dev`
- `start`: Alias for `dev`
- `lint`: `bunx eslint src/` for code quality
- `format`: `bunx prettier --write .` for code formatting
- `preview`: `bunx serve public/` for production preview
- `clean`: Clean reinstall of dependencies

### Documentation Updated

- README.md updated with Bun-specific instructions
- AGENTS.md updated with new build commands
- Package.json scripts optimized for Bun workflow

### Key Benefits Achieved

- **Faster Installation**: Bun's native package resolution
- **Hot Reload**: `bun run --hot` for instant development updates
- **Unified Tooling**: Single runtime for both development and scripts
- **Better DX**: Improved development experience with faster feedback

## Definition of Done

- [x] Migration completed without breaking existing functionality
- [x] All team members successfully using Bun
- [x] Documentation updated with new setup instructions
- [x] CI/CD pipelines updated and tested
- [x] Performance benchmarks show improvement over npm
