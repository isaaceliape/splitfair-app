# User Story: GitHub Pages Deployment with GitHub Actions

## User Story

**As a** developer maintaining the Splitfair PWA,
**I want** to set up automated deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions,
**so that** the application is automatically built and deployed whenever changes are pushed to the main branch, making it easily accessible to users and stakeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow created and functional
- [ ] Project builds successfully in CI environment
- [ ] Application deployed to GitHub Pages automatically
- [ ] Live URL accessible (https://[username].github.io/splitfair-pwa/)
- [ ] PWA functionality works on GitHub Pages (service worker, manifest)
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for PWA requirements
- [ ] Automatic deployment on pushes to main branch
- [ ] Manual deployment option available

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Build time under 5 minutes in CI
- [ ] Deployment process reliable (99%+ success rate)
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in repository
- [ ] Workflow follows GitHub Actions best practices
- [ ] Clear status indicators in repository

## Technical Details

### Current State
- Project uses Vite for building
- Manual build and deployment process
- No CI/CD pipeline configured
- Local development only

### Target State
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- GitHub Pages hosting
- Branch-based deployments (main â†’ production)
- Manual deployment trigger available

### GitHub Actions Workflow Requirements

#### Build Job
- Node.js environment setup
- Bun installation and dependency resolution
- Lint and format checks
- Vite production build
- Build artifact generation

#### Deploy Job
- GitHub Pages deployment action
- Proper base path configuration for GitHub Pages
- Service worker and PWA manifest handling
- Asset optimization

### Configuration Files Needed

#### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install

      - name: Lint and format
        run: bun run lint && bun run format:check

      - name: Build
        run: bun run build

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./docs

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

#### `vite.config.js` Updates
- Base path configuration for GitHub Pages
- PWA manifest URL adjustments
- Asset path handling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Workflow Setup
1. Create `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Set up basic GitHub Actions workflow
3. Configure GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Test workflow execution

### Phase 2: Build Configuration
1. Update Vite config for GitHub Pages base path
2. Ensure PWA assets work with new paths
3. Test build process in CI environment
4. Optimize build for production deployment

### Phase 3: Deployment Configuration
1. Configure GitHub Pages deployment
2. Set up proper permissions and security
3. Test deployment process
4. Verify PWA functionality on live site

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Optimization
1. Set up workflow status badges
2. Monitor build times and success rates
3. Optimize workflow for speed
4. Add error handling and notifications

## GitHub Pages Considerations

### Base Path Configuration
- Repository name affects base path
- Vite config needs `base: '/splitfair-pwa/'`
- Asset paths must account for base path
- PWA manifest URLs need adjustment

### PWA Compatibility
- HTTPS requirement for service workers
- GitHub Pages provides HTTPS automatically
- Service worker scope configuration
- Cache strategies for GitHub Pages URLs

### Asset Handling
- Static assets served from GitHub's CDN
- Cache headers and optimization
- Large assets (images) handled appropriately
- Font and icon loading

## Risks and Mitigations

### High Risk
- **PWA Functionality**: Service workers may not work correctly on GitHub Pages
  - **Mitigation**: Test thoroughly, configure proper scope and paths
- **Base Path Issues**: Asset loading problems with repository path
  - **Mitigation**: Configure Vite base path correctly, test all assets

### Medium Risk
- **Build Failures**: CI environment differences from local
  - **Mitigation**: Use same Bun version, test workflow locally if possible
- **Rate Limiting**: GitHub Actions usage limits
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize workflow, monitor usage

### Low Risk
- **HTTPS Requirements**: PWA needs secure context
  - **Mitigation**: GitHub Pages provides HTTPS by default
- **CORS Issues**: External API calls if any
  - **Mitigation**: Not applicable for current app (offline-first)

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-deployment Testing
- Local build testing with correct base path
- PWA functionality verification
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance testing

### Post-deployment Testing
- Live URL accessibility
- PWA installation capability
- Service worker registration
- Offline functionality
- Mobile responsiveness

### CI/CD Testing
- Workflow syntax validation
- Build artifact verification
- Deployment success confirmation
- Rollback capability testing
