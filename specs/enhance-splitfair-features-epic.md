# EPIC: Enhance Splitfair Features

## Epic Overview

**As a** user of the Splitfair PWA who frequently splits expenses with friends and family,
**I want** enhanced functionality and better user experience,
**so that** I can handle more complex splitting scenarios, track expenses over time, and have more control over how bills are divided.

## Technical Architecture Vision

### Enhanced Data Model

```
Person {
  id: string
  name: string
  income?: number
  customPercentage?: number
}

Expense {
  id: string
  amount: number
  description: string
  category: string
  participants: Person[]
  splittingMethod: 'equal' | 'proportional' | 'custom' | 'exact'
  createdAt: Date
}

Calculation {
  id: string
  expenses: Expense[]
  totalAmount: number
  results: PersonResult[]
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Component Architecture

```
